excerpt: 

  Hi, I’m Dharmesh, a freelance roboticist with a strong background in robotics and embedded systems. With roots in India, I’m currently based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
  
  I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2021, and since then, I’ve worked alongside industry professionals and leading academic educators, gaining hands-on experience across diverse robotics domains.
  
  At present, I’m actively engaged in multiple robotics projects, focusing on system design, control, and real-world implementation.
