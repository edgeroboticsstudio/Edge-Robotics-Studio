 <h2 style="color: #66ccff;"> A Bit About Me </h2>
 <img src="/static/me on vaction.jpeg " alt="Thumbnail" class="blog-image" >
 <p style="color: #66ccff; text-align: center"> <b> Me on my vacation Spring 2025</b></p>
 <p>
<p>I was born in a small village in Gujarat, India, where I spent the first ten years of my life. Those early years shaped who I am today and gave me a strong sense of simplicity and grounding. As I grew older, I moved to a nearby city to continue my studies, marking the beginning of my hostel life and my first real step toward independence. A few years later, I moved again to the central city of the state for my graduation, where life brought new challenges, freedom, and personal growth.</p>
<p>Everything changed in March 2020 when the COVID pandemic hit, and I returned to my home village. I completed the next two years of my graduation from there and graduated in 2021. By the end of that year, I moved back to the central city and began my professional journey. Since then, I’ve been learning continuously, adapting, and shaping the path I want to walk.</p>
<p>Beyond work and studies, I love traveling and exploring new places. I enjoy discovering different cultures, religions, and especially their food. In my free time, I like spending time with myself, watching dramas, anime, and movies, playing video games, and exploring new tech and hardware. Sometimes, I also play badminton to stay active and refreshed.</p>

 <h2 style="color: #66ccff;"> My Professional Journey </h2>
 <img src="/static/Thumbnail.png " alt="Thumbnail" class="blog-image-p" >
 <p style="color: #66ccff; text-align: center"> <b> Me working on Robotics Project </b></p>
 <p>
<p>My journey truly began toward the end of 2021, when I returned to the central city after completing my graduation in Mechanical Engineering. That phase marked my transition from student life into the real world, where responsibility, uncertainty, and growth became part of everyday life. I developed a strong interest in design and began teaching myself various tools and software. After months of learning and practice, I earned an opportunity to train at an MNC, where I gained hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how professional environments function.</p>
<p>After completing my training, I felt the urge to continue my education and dreamed of studying in Germany. I started learning the language and exploring universities, and for a while, everything seemed to fall into place. However, life had other plans. My family hoped I would stay closer to home, and respecting that, I decided not to move abroad. Instead, I prepared for higher studies in India and, despite limited preparation time, cleared the entrance exam and began my PhD journey in July 2024.</p>
<p>A few months into the program, I realized that this path did not align with who I was becoming or what I truly wanted to build. It was a difficult decision, but I chose to step away. I spent much of 2025 with my family, reflecting, learning, and redefining my direction. During this time, I started Edge Robotics Studio, a freelance initiative through which I explore robotics, design, and problem-solving in my own way.</p>
<p>Today, I see my career as an evolving journey rather than a fixed destination. Every experience, whether a success or a setback, has shaped me. I continue to move forward with curiosity, purpose, and the belief that growth comes from staying true to yourself.</p>

 <h2 style="color: #66ccff;"> Where I’m Headed </h2>
<p>The past few years haven’t been easy for me, both professionally and personally. There were moments of confusion, setbacks, and difficult decisions, but each of them taught me something important about myself and what I truly want from life. After stepping away from my previous work, I found myself in a phase that feels like a mix of rest, reflection, and rebuilding. Not exactly a break and not exactly a fresh start, but something in between. A quiet space where I could think clearly, reset my priorities, and slowly shape what comes next.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m spending my time building Edge Robotics Studio, learning, experimenting, and creating at my own pace. Things are moving slowly, but with intention. I’m becoming more comfortable with uncertainty and learning to live with it, because the future is rarely clear. Still, I choose to move forward, even when the path isn’t fully visible. I’m hopeful that 2026 will bring more clarity, stability, and momentum, and for now I’m focused on growth, consistency, and trusting the process.</p>
<p>This space is where I’ll share thoughts, experiences, ideas, and maybe a few experiments. Some posts may be technical, some personal, and others simply reflections from the journey. If you’re reading this, I hope you find something here that resonates with you and reminds you that it’s okay to pause, reflect, and move forward at your own pace.</p>
